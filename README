Arduino / AVRUSB integration
----------------------------

* NOTE: This should now work with Arduino IDE 0018 onward but I've only
        tested with 0020.

* Source now available as a Mercurial repository here:

      <http://code.google.com/p/vusb-for-arduino/>

* Build the USB mini-shield documented here: 

  NOTE: The code will NOW ONLY WORK WITH THE PCB DESIGN
        *NOT* THE PROTOBOARD DESIGN.

* Copy 'UsbKeyboard' directory in the 'libraries' directory to your
  Arduino 'hardware/libraries' directory.

* Open an example sketch from 'examples' directory.

* See 'libraries/UsbKeyboard/ArduinoNotes.txt' for more.

* I've had some USB ports on a MacBook Pro not work while others do.

* Consider GPL 2.0 unless licensed otherwise.
